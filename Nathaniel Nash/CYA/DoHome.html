  <body><font size= "6" >You choose to do your homework. You run upstairs and open your backpack. You put your homework on the table and start doing your homework. In 30 minutes you finished your writing homework and now youâ€™re starting to do your math homework. 1 hour later and you finish all your homework and it is time to eat dinner. After dinner, you go to bed.
     BEEP BEEP! You wake up and hit the snooze button on the alarm clock. Once you brush your teeth and get dressed you run downstairs to eat breakfast. Once breakfast is over you get your backpack on and your shoes on. Then you run to the car to go to school. 5 minutes later and you get to school. You get to your classroom and hand in your homework and sit down in your desk.
