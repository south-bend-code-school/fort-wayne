    <font size= "6">     You play subway surfers for 10 minutes then the iPad glitches and you get kicked out of the game. Then you play parking free till the end of study hall. Once study hall’s over you go to the gym to play hockey. 35 minutes later and it is time to go have lunch. After lunch, you have your afternoon break for 15 minutes. Then you get in class and do some writing until 2:00. After writing you do some reading till 3:00 then you pack up. You have math homework, reading homework, and the homework that was assigned yesterday. You go to aftercare thinking about ‘how you're going to get all your homework done.’
     At aftercare and sign in and wait in line for 5 minutes to get a snack. After your done eating you go outside. 15 minutes later you go inside and play sorry. In the middle of the game. Your mom comes and picks takes you home.
