  <font size= "6">  As you run upstairs you get out your computer and play fortnite. As you play fortnite you talk to your friend through your mike. Once you hear your mother go to sleep you tiptoe downstairs. You play on your Xbox till 12 then you hear someone coming down the stairs. You hide behind the tv so you don’t get in trouble. 15 minutes later and your dad finds you. “What are you doing up so late!”  Your dad yells at you. ”You are grounded from electronics for 5 weeks.” You run upstairs and get in your bed.
     The next day, you get up and you notice it’s 9:00 a.m. You get your clothes on and you hurry downstairs. Once you eat breakfast you run to your car. Once you get to school you run down the hallway and walk out into the classroom. “Why were you late?” the teacher asks you.
     “I got up late,” you explain to the teacher.
     “We'll try to get some sleep tonight.” The teacher says.
     “Okay,” you say as you walk to your desk.
     “Time to hand in your homework,” the teacher says as if she knows you didn't do your homework. You hand in your blank homework.
