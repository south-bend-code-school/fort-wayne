  <font size= "6"> You run upstairs and get ready for bed. In 10 minutes you are ready for a bed The next day, you wake up to the sound of your alarm clock. You climb down the ladder like a sloth. You get your clothes on and brush your teeth. You walk downstairs very slow and then you eat breakfast. Once you finish your breakfast you read till it is time to go to school. You get your backpack on and your shoes on and you run to your van. In 10 minutes you get to school and you have 5 minutes till school starts. Then, you hear the bell ring and you run down the hallway to your classroom. You take your backpack off and empty it. You walk in the classroom and sit down in your seat. “Time to hand in your homework,” the teacher says.
“I forgot about my homework and when I remembered I had homework I had to go to bed,” you explain to your teacher.
“That’s okay you can do your homework during study hall,” the teacher says. As you walk to your desk you get your religion book out and do your morning work then it is study hall.
